# PyCast
Pycast is an Android app which allows the user to control a Linux computer from their android device via WiFi. The Android device acts as both a keyboard and a mouse for input to the Linux computer as well as having an inbuilt share function for sending URLs or files.  One of our main objectives was to get the app working with a raspberry pi and projector for lecturers to be able to deliver a lecture from their phones as opposed to using a laptop and VGA/HDMI cables.
